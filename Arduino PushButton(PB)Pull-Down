// Goal is Making a push button that is pull-down and the Main theme is Serial.Begin 
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
// Start serial communication  
Serial.begin(9600);  
// Configure pin 5 as an input
pinMode(5, INPUT); 
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
// Read the pushbutton state and make it equal to an int
int sensorVal = digitalRead(5); 
 // Print and Println the button state to the serial monitor  
Serial.print("Button State = "); 
 Serial.println(sensorVal);
